# Allocation:
# A <object-id> <size> <type> <thread-id>
# The new object has ID object-id, which is used to refer to the object in later events; the size in bytes; the type (a Java type as a string); the ID of the allocating thread.

# Death:
# D <object-id>
# Pointer update:
# U <old-target-id> <object-id> <new-target-id><thread-id>
# A field (currently, unspecified) in the object with ID object-id is changed from pointing to old-target-id to point to new-target-id, and this occured in thread-id.

# An object-id of 0 indiacates that this is an update to a static field.

# Method entry:
# M <method-id> <receiver-object-id> <thread-id>
# A call to the method method-id with receiver object receiver-object-id in thread thread-id.

# A origin receiver of 0 indicates that this was a static method

# Method exit:
# E <method-id> <receiver-object-id> <thread-id>
# Return from method method-id with receiver object receiver-object-id in thread thread-id.

# A receiver of 0 indicates this was a static method.
