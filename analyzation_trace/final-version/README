This is the final version of trace analyzation tools in JVM objects research project.

The input trace format is as: 1361422111014 (0x0000013cfb14d126)24000x620191d40x00000040.

Including files:
	format_trace.py, reorganize the trace information
	trace_format_removedeplicate.py, to remove the repeatedly access, such as one continuous access "A A A" will be considerred as "A"
	address-divide-intersize.py, to save the execution time, the trace is analyzed based on different address range
	collect-results.py, combine all the results produced by different address ranges
	benchmark.slurm, submitting the job to the cluster using SLURM (hcc.unl.edu, sandhills)
	benchmark.sh, submitting the job to the cluster using PBS (hcc.unl.edu, tusker)

	3d-plotting.py, plot the 3D access figure
